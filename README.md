### Simplifying Big O

Rule Book

1. Worst Case
2. Remove Constants
3. Different terms for inputs
4. Drop Non Dominants

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Big O Rule 1 - Worst Case

```javascript
// Worst Case: n
const fish = ['dory', 'bruce', 'marlin', 'nemo']
const nemo = ['nemo']
const everyone = [
  'dory',
  'bruce',
  'marlin',
  'nemo',
  'gill',
  'bloat',
  'nigel',
  'squirt',
  'darla',
  'hank',
]
const large = new Array(100000).fill('nemo')

const findNemo = (fish) => {
  let t0 = performance.now()
  for (let i = 0; i < fish.length; i++) {
    console.log('running')
    if (fish[i] === 'nemo') {
      console.log('Found NEMO!')
      break
    }
  }
  let t1 = performance.now()
  console.log('Call to find Nemo took ' + (t1 - t0) + ' milliseconds.')
}

findNemo(large)
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Big O Rule 2 - Remove Constants

```javascript
// Big O(1 + n/2 + 100)
// Big O(n/2 + 101)
// Big O(n/2)
// Big O(n)
const printFirstItemThenFirstHalfThenSayHi100Times = (items) => {
  // O(1)
  console.log(items[0])

  const middleIndex = Math.floor(items.length / 2)
  const index = 0

  // O(n/2)
  while (index < middleIndex) {
    console.log(items[index])
    index++
  }

  // O(100)
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    console.log('hi')
  }
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Big O Rule 3 - Different terms for inputs

```javascript
// boxes, boxes2 are 2 different terms for inputs
// Big O(a + b)
const compressBoxesTwice = (boxes, boxes2) => {
  boxes.forEach((box) => console.log(box)) // O(a)
  boxes2.forEach((box) => console.log(box)) // O(b)
}

compressBoxesTwice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### O(n^2)

```javascript
// Big O(a * b) - Quadratic Time
const boxes = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
const logAllPairsOfArray = (array) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    // O(a)
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
      // O(b)
      console.log(array[i], array[j])
    }
  }
}

logAllPairsOfArray(boxes)
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Big O Rule 4 - Drop Non Dominants

```javascript
// Big O(n + n^2)
// Drop Non Dominants -> Big O(n^2)
const printAllNumbersThenAllPairSums = (numbers) => {
  // O(n)
  console.log('these are the numbers:')
  numbers.forEach((number) => console.log(number))

  // O(n^2)
  console.log('and these are their sums:')
  numbers.forEach((firstNumber) =>
    numbers.forEach((secondNumber) => console.log(firstNumber + secondNumber))
  )
}

printAllNumbersThenAllPairSums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

### 3 Pillars Of Programming

What is good code?

1. Readable
2. Scalable - Speed (Time Complexity)
3. Scalable - memory (Space Complexity)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Space Complexity

When a program executes it has two ways to remember things

- Heap - Store variables
- Stack - Keep track of function calls

What causes Space Complexity?

- Variables
- Data Structures
- Function Call
- Allocations

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Exercise: Space Complexity

```javascript
// Space complexity O(1)
const boooo = n => {
  // space allocation for i is O(1)
  for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
    console.log('booooo');
  }
}
boooo([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

// Space complexity O(n)
const arrayOfHiNTimes = n => {
  // space allocation for Data Structures hiArray is O(n)
  const hiArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    hiArray[i] = 'hi';
  }
  return hiArray;
}
arrayOfHiNTimes(6)

### Exercise: Interview Question

Given 2 arrays, create a function that let's a user know (true/false) whether these two arrays contain any common items.

1. When the interviewer says the question, write down the key points at the top. Make sure you have all the details. Show how organized you are.

```javascript
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'i'];
should return false.

const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'x'];
should return true.
```

2. Make sure you double check: What are the inputs? What are the outputs?

```javascript
What are the inputs? 
2 parameters - arrays

What are the outputs?
return true or false
```

3. What is the most important value of the problem? Do you have time, and space and memory, etc.. What is the main goal?

```javascript
2 parameters - arrays - no size limit
```

4. Don't be annoying and ask too many questions.
5. Start with the naive/brute force approach. First thing that comes into mind. It shows that you’re able to think well and critically (you don't need to write this code, just speak about it).

```javascript
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'a'];

const containsCommonItem = (arr1, arr2) => {
  for (let i=0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    for ( let j=0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
      if(arr1[i] === arr2[j]) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false
}

containsCommonItem(array1, array2);
```

6. Tell them why this approach is not the best (i.e. O(n^2) or higher, not readable, etc...)

```javascript
Time Complexity - O(a*b)
Space Complexity - O(1)
```

7. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things. Any repetition, bottlenecks like O(N^2), or unnecessary work? Did you use all the information the interviewer gave you? Bottleneck is the part of the code with the biggest Big O. Focus on that. Sometimes this occurs with repeated work as well.

8. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follow.

```javascript
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'a'];

array1 = obj {
  a: true,
  b: true,
  c: true,
  x: true
}
array2[index] === obj.properties
```

9.  Modularize your code from the very beginning. Break up your code into beautiful small pieces and add just comments if you need to.

```javascript
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'a'];
const containsCommonItem2 = (arr1, arr2) => {
  // loop through first array and create object where properties === items in the array
  // can we assume always 2 params?
  let map = {};
  for (let i=0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    if(!map[arr1[i]]) {
      const item = arr1[i];
      map[item] = true;
    }
  }

  // loop through second array and check if item in second array exists on created object. 
  for (let j=0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
    if (map[arr2[j]]) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false
}

containsCommonItem2(array1, array2)

// Time Complexity: O(a + b) 
// Space Complexity: O(a)
```

10. Start actually writing your code now. Keep in mind that the more you prepare and understand what you need to code, the better the whiteboard will go. So never start a whiteboard interview not being sure of how things are going to work out. That is a recipe for disaster. Keep in mind: A lot of interviews ask questions that you won’t be able to fully answer on time. So think: What can I show in order to show that I can do this and I am better than other coders. Break things up in Functions (if you can’t remember a method, just make up a function and you will at least have it there. Write something, and start with the easy part.

```javascript
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'a'];
const arrToMap = arr1 => {
  const map = {};
  for (let i=0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    if(!map[arr1[i]]) {
      const item = arr1[i];
      map[item] = true;
    }
  }
  return map;
}

const arrInMap = (map, arr2) => {
  for (let j=0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
    if (map[arr2[j]]) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false
}

const containsCommonItem2 = (arr1, arr2) => {
  const map = arrToMap(arr1);
  return arrInMap(map,arr2);
}

containsCommonItem2(array1, array2)
```

11. Think about error checks and how you can break this code. Never make assumptions about the input. Assume people are trying to break your code and that Darth Vader is using your function. How will you safeguard it? Always check for false inputs that you don’t want. Here is a trick: Comment in the code, the checks that you want to do… write the function, then tell the interviewer that you would write tests now to make your function fail (but you won't need to actually write the tests).

12. Don’t use bad/confusing names like i and j. Write code that reads well.

13. Test your code: Check for no params, 0, undefined, null, massive arrays, async code, etc… Ask the interviewer if we can make assumption about the code. Can you make the answer return an error? Poke holes into your solution. Are you repeating yourself?

```javascript
const arrToMap = (arr1 = []) => {
  const map = {};
  for (let i=0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    if(!map[arr1[i]]) {
      const item = arr1[i];
      map[item] = true;
    }
  }
  return map;
}

const arrInMap = (map, arr2) => {
  for (let j=0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
    if (map[arr2[j]]) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false
}

const containsCommonItem2 = (arr1 = [], arr2 = []) => {
  const map = arrToMap(arr1);
  return arrInMap(map,arr2);
}

containsCommonItem2()
```

14.  Finally talk to the interviewer where you would improve the code. Does it work? Are there different approaches? Is it readable? What would you google to improve? How can performance be improved? Possibly: Ask the interviewer what was the most interesting solution you have seen to this problem

```javascript
const containsCommonItem3 = (arr1, arr2) 
  => arr1.some(item => arr2.includes(item))

containsCommonItem3(array1, array2)
```

15. If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here. It is also common that the interviewer asks you extension questions, such as how you would handle the problem if the whole input is too large to fit into memory, or if the input arrives as a stream. This is a common follow-up question at Google, where they care a lot about scale. The answer is usually a divide-and-conquer approach — perform distributed processing of the data and only read certain chunks of the input from disk into memory, write the output back to disk and combine them later.

### Review Google Interview

```javascript
// [1, 2, 3, 9] Sum = 8, No
// [1, 2, 4, 4] Sum = 8, Yes

// Naive Approach
const hasPairWithSum = (arr, sum) => {
  const len = arr.length;
  for(let i =0; i<len-1; i++){
     for(let j = i+1;j<len; j++){
        if (arr[i] + arr[j] === sum)
            return true;
     }
  }
  return false;
}

hasPairWithSum([1, 2, 3, 9], 8)
hasPairWithSum([1, 2, 4, 4], 8)

// Better Approach
const hasPairWithSum2 = (arr, sum) => {
  const mySet = new Set();
  const len = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++){
    if (mySet.has(arr[i])) {
      return true;
    }
    mySet.add(sum - arr[i]);
  }
  return false;
}

hasPairWithSum2([1, 2, 3, 9], 8)
hasPairWithSum2([1, 2, 4, 4], 8)
```

## **Section 5: Data Structures: Introduction**

### What Is A Data Structure?

- A data structure is a collection of values.
- The values can have relationships among them and they can have functions applied to them.
- All programs are we're modeling real life scenarios.

Question

- How to build one?
- How to Use it?

### How Computers Store Data

- [Computer Memory](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/courses/data-analysis/itdtHTML/node55.html)
- [Registers and RAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpnE6UAfbtU)

- CPU: access RAM and Storage for information
- RAM: fast but limited, non-persistent
- Storage: more but slow, persistent

### Operations On Data Structures

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching
- Sorting
- Access

## **Section 6: Data Structures: Arrays**

### Arrays Introduction

| Operation | Big O |
| --------- | ----- |
| lookup    | O(1)  |
| push      | O(1)  |
| insert    | O(n)  |
| delete    | O(n)  |

```javascript
// 4 * 4 = 16 bytes of storage
const strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
strings[2]

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

//push
strings.push('e');  // O(1)

//pop
strings.pop();  // O(1)
strings.pop();  // O(1)

//unshift
// 'x' will push all elements to their right
// ['x', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
//   0    1    2    3    4
strings.unshift('x')  // O(n)

//splice
strings.splice(2, 0, 'alien');  // O(n)
```

### Static vs Dynamic Arrays

JavaScript Array is dynamic 

| Array Operation | Big O | Dynamic Array | Big O        |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------ |
| lookup          | O(1)  | lookup        | O(1)         |
| push            | O(1)  | append*       | O(1) or O(n) |
| insert          | O(n)  | insert        | O(n)         |
| delete          | O(n)  | delete        | O(n)         |

### Implementing An Array

```javascript
class MyArray {
  constructor() {
    this.length = 0;
    this.data = {};
  }
  get = index => this.data[index];  // O(1)

  push = item => {  
    this.data[this.length] = item;  // O(1)
    this.length++;
    return this.data;
  }
  
  pop = () => {
    const lastItem = this.data[this.length - 1];  // O(1)
    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    this.length--;
    return lastItem;
  }
  
  deleteAtIndex = index => {
    const item = this.data[index];
    this.shiftItems(index); // O(n)
    return item;
  }
  
  shiftItems = index => {
    for (let i = index; i < this.length - 1; i++) { 
      this.data[i] = this.data[i + 1];  // O(n)
    }
    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    this.length--;
  }
}

const myArray = new MyArray();
myArray.push('hi');
myArray.push('you');
myArray.push('!');
myArray.get(0);
myArray.pop();
myArray.deleteAtIndex(0);
myArray.push('are');
myArray.push('nice');
myArray.shiftItems(0);
myArray
```

### Exercise: Reverse A String

```javascript
const reverse1 = (str = '') => {
  if(!str || typeof str != 'string' || str.length < 2 ) return str;
  
  const backwards = [];
  const totalItems = str.length - 1;
  for(let i = totalItems; i >= 0; i--){
    backwards.push(str[i]);
  }
  return backwards.join('');
}

const reverse2 = (str = '') => str.split('').reverse().join('');
const reverse3 = (str = '') => [...str].reverse().join('');

reverse1('Timbits Hi')
reverse2('Timbits Hi')
reverse3('Timbits Hi')
```

### Exercise: Merge Sorted Arrays

```javascript
const ascendingSort = (a, b) => a - b;
const descendingSort = (a, b) => b - a;

const mergeSortedArrays = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2).sort(ascendingSort);
mergeSortedArrays([0,3,4,31], [3,4,6,30]);
```

### Interview Questions: Arrays

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Interview Questions](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/learn/lecture/12310382#content)

```javascript
// Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

// Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
// Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
// return [0, 1].

const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = nums.length - 1;
  while(low < high) {
    if(nums[low] + nums[high] === target) return [low, high];
    else if(nums[low] + nums[high] > target) high--;
    else low++;
  }
};

twoSum([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 10)
